Hallway, foyer, guest bat, dining room, and full to the studs kitchen!\nIs it disruptive?  Of course, but the crew were fantastic about making it the least disruptive possible..  Excellent cleanup at the end of the day, fantastic dust abatement, etc. etc.\nWere there a couple small issues?  Yup, but there is no project of this size that doesn't!\nMatt and the crew took care of the issues and we all worked together so we are fantastically happy!\nIt is our dream kitchen.\nCouldn't ask for better functionality, lighting, quality, etc. etc.\nWe through a couple pretty big changes at them right in the middle too... The crew, took our changes and ran with them with not even a heartbeat!\nMy only slight comment if there are any is we would have liked a little more guidance at times..    The communication was great, but there were a few times we just didn't quite know what we need to buy, not buy, etc.  But in the end we all worked together to finish up a great project in a timely manner..\nWe had been tired of being burned by contractors, but not this time!  We already know we will be working with Remodels by Design for our master bath when the time comes.....\nBook them, let them go about their work, and enjoy the results!\nand for the amount of work that was done we feel the price was fantastic and zero corners were cut at any time",

They were so professional and easy to work with that when our bathroom flooded, we used them again for a complete bathroom makeover. What’s even better is that they are local. I’ve recommended them to countless neighbors who love our new kitchen as much as we do!",

Matt and Brian were a pleasure to have in our home, they are communicative, hard-working, and true pros.

Matt was the most reasonable quote from 3 different contractors and we liked his ideas (and that this is a family owned, local business).

We highly recommend them and look forward to working with them on additional projects in the future.",

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Fantastic experience with Matt, LaKeyia and the whole crew.
So, this was a big project..   Hallway, foyer, guest bat, dining room, and full to the studs kitchen!
Is it disruptive?  Of course, but the crew were fantastic about making it the least disruptive possible..  Excellent cleanup at the end of the day, fantastic dust abatement, etc. etc.
Were there a couple small issues?  Yup, but there is no project of this size that doesn't!
Matt and the crew took care of the issues and we all worked together so we are fantastically happy!
It is our dream kitchen.
Couldn't ask for better functionality, lighting, quality, etc. etc.
We through a couple pretty big changes at them right in the middle too... The crew, took our changes and ran with them with not even a heartbeat!
My only slight comment if there are any is we would have liked a little more guidance at times..    The communication was great, but there were a few times we just didn't quite know what we need to buy, not buy, etc.  But in the end we all worked together to finish up a great project in a timely manner..
We had been tired of being burned by contractors, but not this time!  We already know we will be working with Remodels by Design for our master bath when the time comes.....
Book them, let them go about their work, and enjoy the results!
and for the amount of work that was done we feel the price was fantastic and zero corners were cut at any time</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">We used Remodels By Design to completely renovate our 1996 kitchen. From design planning through to completion, we couldn’t be happier. They were so professional and easy to work with that when our bathroom flooded, we used them again for a complete bathroom makeover. What’s even better is that they are local. I’ve recommended them to countless neighbors who love our new kitchen as much as we do!</div>

They recently completed three bathrooms for us, and the transformation is incredible. Matt and Brian were a pleasure to have in our home, they are communicative, hard-working, and true pros. Even though the timeline stretched a bit beyond the initial estimate, the attention to detail they provided made it clear they weren't cutting corners. It's rare to find contractors who are this easy to work with. We're so happy with the finished product!</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Our first experience with a home project. Matt was the most reasonable quote from 3 different contractors and we liked his ideas (and that this is a family owned, local business).  Matt did a great job guiding us through the process and his wife helped a lot with picking out colors and design which was wonderful. We highly recommend them and look forward to working with them on additional projects in the future.</div>
